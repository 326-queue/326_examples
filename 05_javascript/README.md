# 05 Basic JavaScript

To run this example in your programming environment first start the
HTTP server:

```bash
$ python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Next, you need to contact the HTTP server using an HTTP client. You
can easily test this from the command line:

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8080
```

Alternatively, and perhaps more interesting, you can open a browser on
your host operating system and navigate to http://localhost:8080. We
recommend using chrome, however, any browser should work. The HTTP
request will be sent to your localhost and port. We have mapped port
8080 on your host operating system to port 8080 in your virtual
machine environment.
