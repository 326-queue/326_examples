    <!-- The HTML External Resource Link element (<link>) specifies
	 relationships between the current document and an external
	 resource. This element is most commonly used to link to
	 stylesheets, but is also used to establish site icons (both
	 "favicon" style icons and mobile home screen/app icons) among
	 other things. -->

      Let's use:

      The &lt;span&gt; element is used as a
      generic <strong>inline</strong> element that can be used for
      anything. This element is typically used when there are no other
      inline elements that make sense to use. You see lots of these in
      the wild.

      The &lt;div&gt; element is used as a
      generic <strong>block</strong> HTML element that can be used for
      anything. This element is typically used when there is no other
      block element that makes sense to use. You see lots of these in
      the wild.
